We at Decagon Train service are building a train management system that takes people to 5 locations[â€œAbuja", "Benue", "Lagos", "Katsina", "Sambisa"]. You are expected to build a platform that enables us to send equal number of people to this locations irrespective of the number of passengers. We can't send more than 50 passengers in total (our train can only take 50 people per trip to the 5 locations available). If the passengers available exceeds 50, then the remaining passengers are taken into the reservation list, pending if there is a shuffle count available which indicates how many extra trips the train can make per day.  Providing we have passengers &lt; 50, then we would have to assign equal number of passengers to this locations and upon having remianing passengers, they would be taking into reservation list.  Also, providing we have passengers &lt; 5 (length/number of location), then we would have an empty boarding list, with reservation containing the passengers available).  For every extra trip taken shuffle count is decremented while for every trip count is incremented.
